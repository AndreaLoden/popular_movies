# Popular Movies App for Udacity Nanodegree

## Project Overview
In this project, I completed the **Popular Movies** app to
show movie posters on a grid and more infos about the movies on a separate DetailActivity

## What Did I Learn and what is included?
In this project:
- Build a UI layout for multiple Activities.
- Launch these Activities via Intent.
- Fetch data from themovieDB API

- Network calls with Retrofit
- LiveData and ViewModel from Architecture components are used for DB operations

## Next steps
I plan to convert it to kotlin after it is reviewed and stage 2 is reviewed
